# Blog REST API

This is a RESTful API for a simple blogging platform

## Features

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) - A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints
- [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com) - A library for interacting with SQL databases from Python code with Python objects based on Python type annotations, and powered by Pydantic and SQLAlchemy
- [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org) - A lightweight database migration tool for usage with the SQLAlchemy Database Toolkit for Python
- [PyJWT](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io) - A Python library which allows you to encode and decode JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io) - A collection of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate interactive documentation from an OpenAPI-compliant API
- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) - A framework that makes it easy to write small, readable tests, and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) - A powerful, open source object-relational database system
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) - A set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers
