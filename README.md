# Blog REST API

This is a RESTful API for a simple blogging platform.

## Features

- [**FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) - A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints
- [**SQLModel**](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com) - A library for interacting with SQL databases from Python code with Python objects based on Python type annotations, and powered by Pydantic and SQLAlchemy
- [**Alembic**](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org) - A lightweight database migration tool for usage with the SQLAlchemy Database Toolkit for Python
- [**PyJWT**](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io) - A Python library which allows you to encode and decode JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- [**Swagger UI**](https://swagger.io) - A collection of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate interactive documentation from an OpenAPI-compliant API
- [**Pytest**](https://docs.pytest.org) - A framework that makes it easy to write small, readable tests, and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries
- [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org) - A powerful, open source object-relational database system
- [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com) - A set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers

## Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- Stable internet connection

## Setup

To run the application locally:

- **Clone the project**

  `git clone https://github.com/rodney-kimathi/blog-backend.git`

- **Switch to the project directory**

  `cd blog-backend`

- **Copy application secrets**

  `cp .env.template .env`

- **Start the application**

  `docker-compose up -d`

- **Run database migrations**

  `docker-compose exec app alembic upgrade head`

- **Run the tests**

  `docker-compose exec app pytest`

- **Shut down the application**

  `docker-compose down -v`

## Usage

To use the API, you can make requests to the provided endpoints.

Detailed documentation of the endpoints, including request and response formats, can be found in the OpenAPI documentation automatically generated by FastAPI.

For access, visit the [documentation](http://localhost:8080/docs) once the application is running.

## Considerations

- **Framework: FastAPI**

  - **Decision**: FastAPI was chosen for its speed, modern features, and ease of use.
  - **Trade-off**: While Django or Flask could offer more features out of the box, FastAPI provides better performance and scalability for an API-centric application.

- **Database: PostgreSQL with SQLModel**

  - **Decision**: PostgreSQL was selected for its reliability and advanced features. SQLModel, built on SQLAlchemy and Pydantic, provides an easy way to work with SQL databases using Python type annotations.
  - **Trade-off**: While NoSQL databases like MongoDB offer flexibility, PostgreSQL's relational nature is more suitable for structured data and complex queries needed in a blogging platform.

- **Containerization: Docker**

  - **Decision**: Docker was used to containerize the application for consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
  - **Trade-off**: This adds a layer of complexity in terms of setup and configuration, but ensures a reproducible and isolated environment.

- **Authentication: PyJWT**

  - **Decision**: PyJWT was used to handle JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
  - **Trade-off**: While JWTs are stateless and scalable, they can lead to security issues if not implemented correctly, such as token expiration and revocation.

- **Documentation: Swagger UI**

  - **Decision**: Swagger UI was chosen to provide interactive API documentation.
  - **Trade-off**: While it offers excellent developer experience, it requires careful maintenance to ensure the documentation stays up to date with the API changes.

- **Testing: Pytest**

  - **Decision**: Pytest was selected for its simplicity and powerful features for writing and running tests.
  - **Trade-off**: Comprehensive testing can be time-consuming but ensures the reliability and stability of the application.

## Improvements

- **Comment and Tag Features**: Adding these features would enhance user interaction and content categorization.
- **Multimedia Support**: Enabling support for images, videos, and other media would make the platform more versatile.
- **Object Storage**: Storing content in object storage (e.g., AWS S3) would improve scalability and management of large files.
- **Secure Communication (HTTPS)**: Implementing HTTPS would ensure secure data transmission.
- **Fully Asynchronous**: Making the entire application asynchronous would improve performance and responsiveness.
- **Data Caching**: Implementing caching mechanisms would enhance performance by reducing database load.
- **Data Pagination**: Adding pagination to API responses would improve performance and usability.
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implementing RBAC would enhance security by controlling access based on user roles.
- **Custom Error Handling and Logging**: Better error handling and logging mechanisms would improve debugging and monitoring.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Proper CORS configuration would enable secure cross-origin requests.
- **Code Inspection**: Use of code inspection tools (e.g., linters) would ensure code quality and maintainability.
- **Load Balancing**: Implementing load balancing would improve scalability and availability.
- **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Setting up CI/CD pipelines would streamline development, testing, and deployment processes.
